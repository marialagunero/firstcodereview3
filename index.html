        <p><strong>Hello and my name is Maria Arceli Lagunero. Born and raised in Honolulu. I have been living in Portland, Oregon for the better part of 4 yrs.</strong></p>

        <p> have degrees in French and Commuications. However, for the past 12 yrs I have been RBT (Registered Behavioral Tech) and have been teaching people with disabilities, dealing mostly with autistic children. I am far from home and family and I also love to travel. For these reason I had some friends say I should try taking classes on programming. I hope to one day gain enough skill to work remotely so that I can work abroad and also fly home to Hawaii to take care of elderly family members.</p>

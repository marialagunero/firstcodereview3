        <h2 class="bg-success">About Me</h2>

        <p><strong><span class="hi">Hello</span> and my name is Maria Arceli Lagunero. Born and raised in Honolulu. I have been living in Portland, Oregon for the better part of 4 yrs. I'm curious about the world and everything in it. Always striving to be a better person than I was yesterday. </strong></p>

        <p> I have degrees in French and Commuications. However, for the past 12 yrs I have been working as an RBT (Registered Behavioral Tech) and have been teaching people with disabilities, dealing mostly with autistic children. I am far from home and family and I also love to travel. For these reasons, I've had some friends say I should try taking classes on programming. I'm looking forward to one day gaining enough skills to work remotely. With these skille I want to work abroad and also fly home to Hawaii to take care of family members.</p>
